Hello Peers.  I've created a function called project1() and commented the question and which variable is the answer. Below is the R code with eval=TRUE. Then beneath my R code is the compiled code with graphs. Happy grading!!


```{r, eval=TRUE}
project1 <-  function() {
  
  require(lubridate)
  require(data.table)
  ##Loading and preprocessing the data
  
  ##Load the data - This is the first step in the project.
  raw.ans <<- read.csv("activity.csv", na.strings="NA")
  clean.ans <<- na.omit(raw.ans)  ##We omitted the NA's in processing
  
  clean.ans$date <<- ymd(clean.ans$date)  ##structure date format
  rownames(clean.ans) <<- NULL  ##remove rownames from data frame
  
  ##2.1 Make histogram of the toal number of steps taken each day
  ans <<- aggregate(steps~date,sum, data=clean.ans) ##sum stems by date
  print("2.1 Make histogram of the toal number of steps taken each day")
  plot(ans$date, ans$steps, type="h") ##plot answer
  
  ##2.2 Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
  ans$mean <<- aggregate(steps~date, mean, data=clean.ans)[,2] ##aggregate by mean
  ans$median <<- aggregate(steps~date, median, data=clean.ans)[,2]  ##aggregate by median
  
  print("2.2 Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day")
  print(ans[1:5,]) ##print answer to 2.2

  ##3.1 what is the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
  ans.3a <<- aggregate(steps~interval,sum,data=clean.ans) ##sum steps by interval
  print("3.1 what is the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)")
  plot(ans.3a$interval,ans.3a$steps, type="l")  ##plot answer to 3A
  
  ##3.2 which 5 mintue interval, on average across all the days contains the maximum number of steps
  print("3.2 which 5 mintue interval, on average across all the days contains the maximum number of steps")
  ans.3b <<- ans.3a[ans.3a$steps == max(ans.3a$steps),] 
  print(ans.3b) ##print answer to 3.2
  
  
  ##4.1 Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA's)
  ans.4a <<- nrow(raw.ans) - nrow(clean.ans)
  print("4.1 Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA's)")
  print(ans.4a) ##print answer to 4.1
  
  ##4.2 Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset
  raw2.ans <<- raw.ans
  raw2.ans$date <<- ymd(raw2.ans$date)
  
  print("4.2 Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset")
  print("Our strategy was to fill the missing values with 0 ")
  

  ##4.3 Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
  
  raw2.ans[is.na(raw.ans)] <<- 0 ##Missing values are recorded as 0.  NA's are recorded as 0.
  
  print("4.3 Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in")
  print("Missing Value Dataset created")
  
  
  ##4.4a Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
  
  ans4.4a <<- plot(raw2.ans$date, raw2.ans$steps, type="h") 
  ans4.4a.mean <<- aggregate(steps~date, mean, data=raw2.ans)
  ans4.4a.median <<- aggregate(steps~date, median, data=raw2.ans)
  
  
  print("4.4a Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.")
  print(ans4.4a.mean)
  print(ans4.4a.median)
  
  ##4.4b Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
  
  ans.4b.mean <<- mean(ans$mean) - mean(ans4.4a.mean$steps)
  
  
  
  ans.4b.median <<- mean(ans$median) - mean(ans4.4a.median$steps)
  print("4.4b Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?")
  print(paste0("Difference between means is: ",ans.4b.median))
  print(paste0("Difference between medians is: ", ans.4b.median))
  
  
  ##4.4c What is the impact of inputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
  print("What is the impact of inputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?")
  print("The impact lowered the mean when we replaced NA's with zeros.")
  print("Median was not affected since we replaced NA's with zeros are zero was the median number.")
  
  
  ##5.1 Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

  
  for( i in 1:nrow(clean.ans)){
    
    
    clean.ans$wday[i]<<- weekdays(clean.ans$date[i])
    
    if(clean.ans$wday[i] == "Sunday" | clean.ans$wday[i] =="Saturday") {
      
      clean.ans$wday[i] <<- "Weekend"
      
    } else { clean.ans$wday[i] <<- "Weekday"}
    
    next
    
  }
  
  print("5.1 Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day")
  head(clean.ans)
  
  
  ##5.2 Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

 


}
project1()
